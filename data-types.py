# Python 3 - Data Types 

# Lets see what types of data can be stored in memory and used inside Python applications.

# The Python programming language defines many types of data for many types of operations. We will look at the most widely used data types.

# As an overview, lets enumerate the most famous and useful Python 3 data types -> we have 
# 1. Strings
# 2. Numbers
# 3. Booleans
# 4. Lists
# 5. Sets
# 6. Frozensets
# 7. Tuples
# 8. Ranges 
# 9. Dictionaries
# 10. None 

# All these data types are built-in into the Programming core and you will see that they are very clearly defined and easy to use.

# One way to classify data types is by whether the objects of a data type can be modified after creation or not -> this is called mutability or immutability

#This leads to two kinds of data types 
# 1. Mutable data types; which can be modified after creation-> here we can mention lists, dictionaries and sets
# 2. Immutable data types: which cannot be modified after creation -> here we have strings, numbers and tuples

# Next -> String

a = 2
a = 4
a = 6 
print (a)
# 2a = 2 
_2a = 6
a2 = 10
print (a2)
